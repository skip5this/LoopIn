# LoopIn — Chrome Web Store Listing

## Short Description (132 chars)
Give your AI coding agent eyes. Capture any UI element, text, or a11y data with one click and send it as context.

## Detailed Description
Your AI coding agent is powerful but blind. It can write code, refactor components, and debug — but it can't see what you're looking at in the browser. LoopIn fixes that.

Point. Click. Your agent gets full context — DOM, styles, accessibility data, component hierarchy. It's like giving your AI a pair of eyes.

Built for builders working with Claude, Cursor, Copilot, or any MCP-compatible agent. All data stays local. Nothing leaves your machine.
